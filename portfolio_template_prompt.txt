## Security Best Practices

### Authentication & Authorization
1. **Password Security:**
   - Use bcrypt with minimum 12 salt rounds
   - Enforce strong password requirements
   - Implement password history
   - Session timeout after inactivity

2. **JWT Implementation:**
   - Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
   - Refresh token rotation
   - Secure httpOnly cookies
   - CSRF protection

3. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Login attempts: 5 per 15 minutes
   - Contact form: 3 per hour per IP
   - API calls: 100 per minute per user

### Data Validation
1. **Input Sanitization:**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize HTML content
   - Check file upload types and sizes
   - Prevent XSS attacks

2. **API Security:**
   - Validate request schemas
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use CORS appropriately
   - Sanitize database queries

### File Upload Security
1. **File Validation:**
   - Check file types and extensions
   - Limit file sizes (images: 5MB, documents: 10MB)
   - Scan for malware (if possible)
   - Generate unique filenames

2. **Storage Security:**
   - Use cloud storage with proper permissions
   - Implement file access controls
   - Backup important files
   - Clean up unused files

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend Optimization
1. **Image Optimization:**
   - Use Next.js Image component
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Provide multiple image formats (WebP, AVIF)
   - Responsive images with proper sizing

2. **Code Splitting:**
   - Dynamic imports for admin dashboard
   - Route-based code splitting
   - Component-level splitting for heavy components

3. **Caching Strategy:**
   - Static generation where possible
   - Browser caching headers
   - CDN for static assets
   - Service worker for offline functionality

### Backend Optimization
1. **Database Optimization:**
   - Proper indexing for queries
   - Pagination for large datasets
   - Caching frequently accessed data
   - Connection pooling

2. **API Optimization:**
   - Response compression
   - Efficient data fetching
   - Background job processing
   - API response caching

## SEO & Analytics

### SEO Implementation
1. **Meta Tags:**
   - Dynamic meta descriptions
   - Open Graph tags
   - Twitter Cards
   - Structured data (JSON-LD)

2. **Technical SEO:**
   - XML sitemap generation
   - Robots.txt configuration
   - Canonical URLs
   - Page speed optimization

### Analytics Integration
1. **Basic Analytics:**
   - Google Analytics 4
   - Page view tracking
   - User behavior analysis
   - Conversion tracking

2. **Custom Analytics:**
   - Project view tracking
   - Contact form submissions
   - Download tracking
   - Social media click tracking

   - Not sanitizing user inputs
   - Missing rate limiting
   - Improper file upload handling

2. **Data Protection:**
   - Not encrypting sensitive data
   - Logging sensitive information
   - Missing backup strategies
   - Poor access controls

### Performance Issues
1. **Frontend Problems:**
